# Media

<!--
This section is collapsed by default and readers click to expand it and see all your media attachments.
The media in PRs can get very large if the PR adds a lot of content or covers many bases. This makes it easier to sort and condense.
The title is written in HTML tags for markdown and must be within the <summary> tags or you won't see it.
You must have an empty line after the <p> and before the </p> or your images will not load.
You cannot have a line above nor below a video file or it will not load the video embed either.
